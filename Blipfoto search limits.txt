Hi Paul,

Please accept my apologies for the delay in getting back to you. I've
now increased the allowed value of the "max" parameter in the get/search
resource to 1000 for your API key; note that this will only work for
searches in the format "by [username]" such as "by joe" or "by pauldoo";
if you request this many results for a generic keyword search you'll
still get an error.

Hope this is all you need!

Kind regards,
Graham
